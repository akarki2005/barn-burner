# alpha v1.1 patch notes

# new features and gameplay changes
- new title screen and logo
- regulation time reduced from 2:00 to 1:30
- added boost mechanic; players can boost to increase movement speed by 50% if they have boost available (boost bar has some green)

# bug fixes and general improvements

- framerate no longer capped at 30fps (will now match display)
- fixed a bug where the timer was showing the floor rather than the ceiling function of the time left, leading to situations where goals could be scored with 0 seconds on the clock
- general refactoring of code to improve performance/readability
