## About

* In Barn Burner, you compete locally against one other player in a timed air hockey battle
* Games are 90 seconds in length, with sudden-death overtime being played to break ties
* There are 32 selectable teams in the game - inspired by the 32 teams in the National Hockey League

### Game Modes

* Classic: A classic air hockey battle - each team has one controllable player and a standard size net to defend
* Chaos (coming soon): A more frantic experience - each team has an attacking player and a goalie, with a very large net to defend

### Series Length

* Exhibition: A single elimination game - winner takes all!
* Best of 3/5/7 Series: Compete in a multi-game playoff series with the same teams, with alternating home/away splits

## Future Updates

Currently, I'm hard at work on alpha v1.3, which is shaping up to be a fairly substantial release. In this update, I'm planning to include...

* Chaos (new game mode): Larger nets, and each player gets a goalie and attacking player to control. You can only control one of your players at a time though, adding an extra layer of complexity to the game.
* On-ice advertisements: If you're not tired of ads being shoved down your throat in real life hockey games, now you can have them shoved down your throat in virtual hockey games too! Don't worry, they're not real ads, just parodies of existing companies.
* UI upgrades: A less ugly user interface.

At the moment, I think I'll be able to get alpha v1.3 released sometime in mid-January, but it might be pushed to the end of the month.

Beyond this update, there are still a few key features I want to add, but overall, I'm beginning to wind down development of the game. Some final features I'm looking to add are...

* Sound effects
* Achievements
* Saved Games/Series
* Tutorial
