## About

* In Barn Burner, you compete locally against one other player in a timed air hockey battle
* Games are 90 seconds in length, with sudden-death overtime being played to break ties
* There are 32 selectable teams in the game - inspired by the 32 teams in the National Hockey League

### Game Modes

* Classic: A classic air hockey battle - each team has one controllable player and a standard size net to defend
* Chaos: A more frantic experience - each team has an attacking player and a goalie, with a very large net to defend

### Series Length

* Exhibition: A single elimination game - winner takes all!
* Best of 3/5/7 Series: Compete in a multi-game playoff series with the same teams, with alternating home/away splits
