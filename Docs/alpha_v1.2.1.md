# Alpha v1.2.1 Patch Notes

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

- fixed a bug where home team was not correct when starting a new series after having already played through one
- fixed a bug where the puck could be fully across the goal line and not count as a goal (caused by reduction in puck size in alpha v1.2)
- some minor tweaks and improvements
