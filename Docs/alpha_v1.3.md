# Alpha v1.3 Patch Notes

## New Features and Gameplay Changes

* New game mode: Chaos
	* In this frantic, fast-paced variation of the game, each player has a goalie and attacking player to control
	* The goalie's x-position is fixed along their respective goal line, and they can only move up or down to protect their net
	* The attacking player may move freely throughout the rink (including to enter the goalie crease periodically to help out on defense)
	* The nets are approximately twice as large as in the classic game mode, making defending them a more challenging task
* On-ice parody advertisements
	* Tired of being bombarded by advertisements everywhere you go in life? Looking for an experience where you can escape from it all?
	* Well, this game is not the place to look! 
	* Introducing on-ice advertisements, featuring parodies of some popular companies.
		* *Advertisements are placed in 4 spots around center ice, and are randomly selected from a pool of parody logo art I have created*

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

* Cleaned up some code under the hood to improve performance
