# Alpha v1.1 Patch Notes

## New Features and Gameplay Changes

* New title screen and logo
* Regulation time reduced from 2:00 to 1:30
* Increased player size by around 30%
* Added boost mechanic
	* Each player has a boost meter displayed on the top header of the game screen
	* If the boost meter is green and not empty, players can press c (p1) or n (p2) while moving to boost
	* Boosting increases player movement speed by 50%, but it depletes quickly - use it wisely!
	* If you fully deplete your boost, it will be locked until it fully regenerates, and will be yellow during this time
	* If you partially deplete your boost, it will begin to regenerate after a short delay, and will still remain usable

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

* Framerate no longer capped at 30fps (will now match display)
* fixed a bug where goals could sometimes be scored with 0 seconds on the clock
* general refactoring of code to improve performance
