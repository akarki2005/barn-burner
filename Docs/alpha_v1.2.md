# Alpha v1.2 Patch Notes

## New Features and Gameplay Changes

* Reduced puck and player size by 22% and 10% respectively
	* *In alpha v1.1, I made some adjustments to player size that ended up making it very difficult to score, leading to lots of 1-0 games (boring). This change is intended to remedy this issue, and I'll be watching closely to see if more tweaks will be necessary in the future.*
* Revamped game screen
	* Rink now displays logo of home team at center ice
	* New, more detailed textures for center redline and goalie crease
	* Boost meters have been moved to the bottom, along with the (new) series score display info
* Best of 3/5/7 series
	* In the pre game screen, you can now select between a single elimination game or a best of 3/5/7 series
	* If a series is chosen, the bottom bar of the game screen will display the current status of the series
	* In a series, teams will alternate home and away games based on series length and game number
* New art for away teams

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

* General UI improvements
* General refactoring of code to improve performance
